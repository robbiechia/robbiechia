# Hi, I'm Robbie! 👋

I'm a final year **Data Science & Analytics** student at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, currently working on exciting projects in **machine learning**, **NLP**, and **data visualization**. I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and eager to explore the practical deployment of data science models. Here's a brief overview of my skills:

- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL (familiar with Java & C)
- **Data Science**: Machine Learning, LLMs, Optimisation Techniques, Natural Language Processing
- **Data Visualization**: Python (Matplotlib), R (ggplot2), PowerBI  
- **Deployment & DevOps**: Docker (basic usage)  

## 🚀 I'm currently working on / Future projects

- **How to beat wordle**: A passion project to dive into the statistics of one of my favourite games and design a model for optimal gameplay through various gamemodes & considerations.
- **What's the sentiment of your texts**: An add-on to my Sentiment analysis project from 2 years ago, to practice some frontend development in creating an interface.

## 💻 Some of my past projects

- **Character-level Large Language Model**: Training a transformer-based language model to explore trade-offs between model performance and computational cost.
- **NLP Sentiment Analysis**: Building a simple sentiment analysis model based on twitter text dataset.
- **E-commerce Optimization**: Explored route & delivery optimisation processes for a school project.
